        "The yakfolk attempts to magically possess a humanoid or giant. The yakfolk must touch the target throughout a short rest, or the attempt fails. At the end of the rest, the target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be possessed by Chief Kartha, which disappears with everything it is carrying and wearing. Until the possession ends, the target is {@condition incapacitated}, loses control of its body, and is unaware of its surroundings. The yakfolk now controls the body and can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment; its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; and its proficiencies. It otherwise uses the target's statistics, except the target's knowledge, class features, feats, and proficiencies.",
        "The possession lasts until either the body drops to 0 hit points, Chief Kartha ends the possession as an action, or Chief Kartha is forced out of the body by an effect such as the {@spell dispel evil and good} spell. When the possession ends, Chief Kartha reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body and is {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn. If the host body dies while it is possessed by Chief Kartha, Chief Kartha dies as well, and its body doesn't reappear."
