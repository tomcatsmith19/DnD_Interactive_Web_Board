Any creature in that area must make a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) radiant damage and, if the creature can see the light, is {@condition blinded} until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half the damage and isn't {@condition blinded}."
