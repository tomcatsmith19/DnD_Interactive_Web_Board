If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the leviathan. A swallowed creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the leviathan, and it takes 21 (6d6 damage) acid damage at the start of each of the leviathan's turns.",

If the leviathan dies, a swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}."
