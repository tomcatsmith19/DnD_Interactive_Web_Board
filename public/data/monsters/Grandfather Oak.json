These trees have the same statistics as a {@creature treant}, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of Grandfather Oak. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until Grandfather Oak dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until Grandfather Oak takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible."
