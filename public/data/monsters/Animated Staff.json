Any creature that successfully grapples the staff must succeed on a {@dc 12} Charisma saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by the staff until the staff is no longer in its grasp. While the creature is {@condition charmed}, the staff can issue commands to it, which the creature does its best to obey. The creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that successfully resists the staff's control can't be {@condition charmed} by it for 24 hours.",
