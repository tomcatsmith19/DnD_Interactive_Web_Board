Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature dies if the breath reduces it to 0 hit points. Additionally, any Medium or smaller Humanoid killed by the breath's damage, as well as every corpse of such a creature within the cone, becomes a zombie (see the Monster Manual) under Karavarix's control. The zombie acts on Karavarix's initiative but immediately after Karavarix's turn. Absent any other command, the zombie tries to kill any non-Undead creature it encounters."
