The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a {@spell daylight} spell; don't count that time. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting {@spell remove curse}, {@spell greater restoration}, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse."
