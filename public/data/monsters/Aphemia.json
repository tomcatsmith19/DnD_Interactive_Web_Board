A {@condition frightened} creature takes 7 (2d6 damage) psychic damage at the start of its turn while Aphemia is singing. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Aphemia's Discordant Song for the next 24 hours. Aphemia must take a bonus action on her subsequent turns to continue singing. She can stop singing at any time. The song ends if Aphemia is {@condition incapacitated} or dies."
