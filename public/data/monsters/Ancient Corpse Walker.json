On a failure, the humanoid is {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if not averting its eyes from the corpse walker, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature failing two of these saving throws becomes cursed with disturbing thoughts. Such a creature can't benefit from a short or long rest until the curse is removed. On a successful save, the target is immune to any corpse walker's Cursed Gaze for the next 24 hours.",

Anything it's wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies. In cloud form, the ancient corpse walker can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It's weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. This cloud spreads around corners. If air can pass through a space, the cloud can do so without squeezing, but it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, except those against wind. The cloud form is immune to nonmagical damage other than that from sunlight.",
