Caradoc can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn Undead, and he retains his alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, immunity to being {@condition charmed} and {@condition frightened}, and his Divisive Whispers bonus action. He otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.",

The target is immune to Caradoc's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
