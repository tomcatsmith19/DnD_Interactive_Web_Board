The {@condition charmed} target is {@condition incapacitated}, and instead of holding its breath underwater, it tries to breathe normally and immediately runs out of breath, unless it can breathe water. If the {@condition charmed} target is more than 5 feet away from the kelpie, the target must move on its turn toward the kelpie by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks.",

A {@condition charmed} target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.",
