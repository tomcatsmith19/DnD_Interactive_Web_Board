If the target is a creature, scarabs burrow into its body, and the creature takes 3 (1d6 damage) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. Any creature can use an action to kill or remove the scarabs with fire or a weapon that deals piercing damage, causing 1 damage of the appropriate type to the target.
