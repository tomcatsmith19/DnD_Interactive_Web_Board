On each of its turns while berserk, the skaab attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the skaab attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the skaab goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.",

The skaab must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a {@dc 15} Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the skaab ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the skaab might go berserk again."
