If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called chaos phage. While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 ({@dice 3d6}) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a {@creature red slaad} or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a {@creature green slaad}. Only a {@spell wish} spell can reverse the transformation."
