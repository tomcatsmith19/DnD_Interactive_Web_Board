It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} until the start of its next turn. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions."
