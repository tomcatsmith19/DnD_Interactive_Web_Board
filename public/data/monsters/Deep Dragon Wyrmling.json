On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10 damage) psychic damage, and it is {@condition frightened} of the dragon for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
