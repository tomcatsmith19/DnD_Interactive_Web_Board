The image lasts for 1 minute. Each creature hostile to the draconian within 10 feet of the image must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} of the spectral image for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
