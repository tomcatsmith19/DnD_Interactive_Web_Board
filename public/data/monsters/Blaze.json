As an action, a creature can try to snap the rod, doing so with a successful {@dc 14} Strength check. The snapped rod releases its fiery energy in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw, taking 6 ({@damage 1d12}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
