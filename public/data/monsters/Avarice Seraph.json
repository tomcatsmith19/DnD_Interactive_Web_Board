If the {@condition charmed} target is more than 5 feet from the seraph, the target must move as far as it can toward the seraph, trying to come within 5 feet. The target avoids obvious danger, including opportunity attacks. If the target can't avoid such danger, the target can repeat the saving throw before entering the dangerous area. While an affected creature is within 5 feet of the seraph, the creature can't take reactions and spends its turns staring at the desirable objects.",
        "The target also repeats the saving throw if the target is subjected to a harmful effect, if the target can't see or hear the seraph, and at the end of each of the target's turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends for it. A target that successfully saves is immune to the Voice of Avarice of this seraph or any lesser seraph for the next 24 hours."
