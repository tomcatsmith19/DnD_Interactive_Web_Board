        "Asharra must grind the orchid to powder, inhale it, and dance in circles around the ritual's beneficiaries uninterrupted while seven other aarakocra chant prayers to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. When the dance concludes, Asharra's wings disappear and she loses the ability to fly. The ritual's beneficiaries each gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet (allowing them to fly 4 miles per hour). This benefit lasts for 3 days, after which Asharra's wings reappear and she regains the ability to fly."

When all five have finished their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance again until it finishes a short rest. When the elemental returns to the Elemental Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return with it."
