Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained} and unable to breathe, unless it can breathe water. If the save is successful, the target is pushed out of Waeloquay's space. Waeloquay can grapple one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of Waeloquay's turns, each target {@condition grappled} by it takes 21 (3d8 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage. A creature within 5 feet of Waeloquay can pull a creature or object out of it by taking an action to make a DC 22 Strength check and succeeding."
