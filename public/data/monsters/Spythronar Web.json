To avoid adhering when touching the web, a creature must succeed on a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw, but a creature hit by the web's crush attack doesn't receive a saving throw. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the web is also {@condition grappled} by it (escape {@dc 13}). If adhered to a target larger than it can grapple, the web can release the adhesive or remain adhered and be dragged along as the target moves. Neither choice requires an action from the web. Removing an object adhered to the web or the web from anything it's adhered to requires a successful {@dc 13} Strength (Athletics) check as an action."
