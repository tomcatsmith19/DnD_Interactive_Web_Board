That area becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for 1 minute. Each creature on the ground that is {@status concentration||concentrating} must succeed on a {@dc 25} Constitution saving throw or the creature's {@status concentration} is broken.",
        "The shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a {@dc 25} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 ({@damage 5d6}) bludgeoning damage, is knocked {@condition prone}, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is {@condition restrained}, requiring a successful {@dc 20} Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall {@condition prone} or become trapped."
