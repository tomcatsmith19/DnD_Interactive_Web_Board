If the target is humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by the vampire for 1 minute.

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0."
