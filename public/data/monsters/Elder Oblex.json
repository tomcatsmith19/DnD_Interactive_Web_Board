This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate {@dice 2d6 + 1} different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed."

Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the {@dice d4} becomes a {@dice d6}, the {@dice d6} becomes a {@dice d8}, and so on until the die becomes a {@dice d20}, at which point the target becomes {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour.
