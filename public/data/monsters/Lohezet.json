        "Lohezet magically conjures a billowing cloud of purple fog in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet of himself. The area within the sphere is heavily obscured, and when a creature starts its turn in the sphere or enters the sphere for the first time on a turn, it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 39 (6d12 damage) poison damage and is {@condition poisoned} until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition poisoned}. The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until Lohezet ends it early (no action required), or until Lohezet uses this action again. A strong wind disperses the cloud."
