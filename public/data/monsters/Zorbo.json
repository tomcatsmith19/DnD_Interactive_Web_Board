On a failed save, one such item worn or carried by the creature (the target's choice) magically deteriorates, taking a permanent and cumulative \u00e2\u02c6\u20191 penalty to the AC it offers, and the zorbo gains a +1 bonus to AC until the start of its next turn. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield or magic item that drops to a 0 AC increase is destroyed."
