These trees have the same statistics as a {@creature tree}, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the tree. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the tree dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the tree takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible."
