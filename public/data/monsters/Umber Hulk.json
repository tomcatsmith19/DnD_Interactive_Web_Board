        "On a failed saving throw, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a {@dice d8} to determine what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action but uses all its movement to move in a random direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes one melee attack against a random creature, or it does nothing if no creature is within reach.",

If the creature looks at the umber hulk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."
