While the creature is affected by this hex, whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it must roll a {@dice d6} and subtract the number rolled from the {@dice d20} roll. On any turn in which it suffers the effect of the hex, the target can attack an ally as a reaction, ignoring the effect of the hex when it does so. It can then ignore the effect of the hex until the end of its turn."
