If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly {@condition petrified}. Otherwise, on a failed save the creature begins to turn to stone and is {@condition restrained}. The {@condition restrained} creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming {@condition petrified} on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the {@spell greater restoration} spell or other magic. Unless {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Hythonia until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Hythonia in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If Hythonia sees herself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of her and in an area of bright light, she is affected by her own gaze."
