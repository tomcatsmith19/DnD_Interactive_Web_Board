If the target is a creature, it suffers a lingering wound that causes it to take 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Each time the slasher hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 3 ({@dice 1d6}). The wound ends if the target regains hit points or if a creature uses an action to stanch the wound, which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check."
