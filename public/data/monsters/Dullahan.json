In addition, it summons three {@creature death's head|VRGR|death's heads}, one of each type, in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of it. The death's heads are under the dullahan's control and act immediately after the dullahan in the initiative order. Additionally, the dullahan can now use the options in the \"Mythic Actions\" section.
