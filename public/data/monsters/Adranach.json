Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the adranach or enters that area for the first time on a turn takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) radiant damage. Additionally, if a creature casts a spell within this area, it must make a {@dc 14} ability check using its spellcasting ability. On a failure, the spell backfires, consuming the spell slot and dealing 3 ({@damage 1d6}) force damage to the caster for each level of the spell slot that was consumed."
