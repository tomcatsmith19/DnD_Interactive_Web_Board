If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly {@condition petrified}. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is {@condition restrained}. The {@condition restrained} creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming {@condition petrified} on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the {@spell greater restoration} spell or other magic.",
