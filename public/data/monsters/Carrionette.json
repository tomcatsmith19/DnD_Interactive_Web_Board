The carrionette gains control of the target's body, and the target is {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour, after which it gains control of the carrionette's body. While controlling the target's body, the carrionette retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It otherwise uses the controlled body's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.",

The swap is also undone if the controlled body takes damage from the carrionette's Silver Needle."
