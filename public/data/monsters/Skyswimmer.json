If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the skyswimmer. A swallowed creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the skyswimmer, and it takes 21 (6d6 damage) acid damage at the start of each of the skyswimmer's turns. If the skyswimmer takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the skyswimmer must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls {@condition prone} in a space within 10 feet of the skyswimmer. If the skyswimmer dies, a swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}."
