        "If the bulette jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked {@condition prone} and take 14 (3d6 + 4 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked {@condition prone}, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls {@condition prone} in the bulette's space."
