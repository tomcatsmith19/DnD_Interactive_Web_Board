The affected ground is also considered difficult terrain for creatures other than the nightmare haunt for the duration of its effect.",

An {@condition unconscious} creature remains asleep until it is no longer in the area with tendrils, takes any damage, or is targeted by a {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic."
