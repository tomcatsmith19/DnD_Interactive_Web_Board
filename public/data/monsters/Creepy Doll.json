It retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being {@condition charmed} and {@condition frightened}. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The target retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while inhabiting the creepy doll's body.",

(The {@spell dispel evil and good} spell will accomplish this, though the doll is not one of the creature types whose possession that spell normally ends.) The body and the doll must be within 5 feet of each other for such an effect to work. The target is immune to this doll's Body Exchange for 24 hours after winning the Intelligence contest or after the exchange ends."
