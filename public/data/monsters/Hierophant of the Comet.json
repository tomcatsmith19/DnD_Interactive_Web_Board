        "The hierophant conjures a manifestation of the All-Consuming Star: brilliant light and haunting screams that fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the hierophant can see within 60 feet of itself. Each creature within the sphere has the {@condition blinded} and {@condition deafened} conditions. Each creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8 damage) psychic damage and has the {@condition incapacitated} condition until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. The manifestation persists until the hierophant dies, has the {@condition incapacitated} condition, uses a bonus action to end the effect, or uses this action again."
